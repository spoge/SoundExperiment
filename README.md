SoundExperiment
===============

A Java application that plays songs made from very primitive sounds from Java's own libraries.

To use, run application and import a song-file with the correct syntax. There are demo-songs included with instructions on how the syntax works.

To do:
  - Combining notes in chord to a more compact format in the song.txt files
  - Add other sounds
  - Some kind of GUI
